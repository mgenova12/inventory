# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#

# Product.destroy_all
# Order.destroy_all
# Invent.destroy_all


# 10.times do 
#   Product.create(name: Faker::Food.ingredient, measurement:['EA', 'BIN'].sample, tuesday_max: rand(3..10), thursday_max: rand(3..10))
# end
