# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#

# Product.destroy_all
# Order.destroy_all
# Invent.destroy_all


# 15.times do 
#   Invent.create()
# end
